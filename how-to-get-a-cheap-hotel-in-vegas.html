You’re not alone! With the city’s reputation for luxury and excess, finding affordable accommodations can be a challenge.</p><p>If you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: it is possible to find cheap hotels in Vegas, if you know where to look and how to book. In this article, we’ll share some tips and tricks to help you score a great deal on your next trip.</p><p>Here’s what we’ll cover:</p><h2>Timing is Everything</h2><p>When it comes to getting a cheap hotel in Vegas, timing is everything. By considering the following tips, you can save a significant amount of money on your hotel stay:</p><h3>Visit During the Off-Season</h3><p>If you want to save money on your hotel room in Vegas, it is worth mentioning that you should avoid visiting during peak season, which typically runs from mid-March to early April, and from mid-May to early June. During these times, hotel prices can skyrocket, and many hotels may require minimum night stays. Instead, try visiting during the off-season, which typically runs from November to February. During this time, hotel prices can drop significantly, and you may be able to snag a great deal.</p><h3>Book in Advance</h3><p>If you want to get a cheap hotel in Vegas, remember to book your hotel room in advance. By booking early, you can take advantage of early-bird discounts and other promotions. Additionally, booking early can give you more options to choose from, as many hotels may sell out during peak season. Keep in mind that some hotels also offer discounts for booking directly through their website, so be sure to check their site before booking through a third-party.</p><h3>Consider Mid-Week Stays</h3><p>If you are looking for a way to save money on your hotel room, consider staying mid-week. Many hotels offer discounted rates for stays from Sunday to Thursday, as these are typically slower days for the hotel industry. By staying mid-week, you can save money and avoid the crowds that typically come with weekend stays. Additionally, many hotels may offer additional perks, such as free breakfast or parking, to incentivize mid-week stays.</p><p>By keeping these tips in mind, you can get a cheap hotel in Vegas without sacrificing quality or convenience. For more information on finding the best hotel deals in Vegas, check out sites such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hotels.com</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Booking.com</a>.</p><h2>Compare Prices and Shop Around</h2><p>When it comes to finding a cheap hotel in Vegas, one of the best things you can do is to compare prices and shop around. By doing a bit of research, you can often save a significant amount of money on your hotel stay. Here are some tips on how to do it:</p><ul><li>Use Hotel Comparison Sites: There are many hotel comparison sites available online that allow you to compare prices from multiple hotels at once. Some popular ones include <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hotels.com</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Booking.com</a>, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Expedia</a>. These sites often have special deals and discounts that you may not find if you book directly with the hotel.</li><li>Check Directly with the Hotel: While hotel comparison sites can be a great way to find deals, it is worth mentioning that sometimes hotels offer special discounts and promotions if you book directly with them. So, it’s always a good idea to check the hotel’s website or call them to see if they have any deals available.</li><li>Sign Up for Email Newsletters: Many hotels offer exclusive deals and discounts to their email subscribers. So, consider signing up for the email newsletter of the hotels you are interested in staying at. This can be a great way to stay informed about any special promotions or discounts they may be offering.</li><li>Consider Package Deals: Sometimes, hotels offer package deals that include things like airfare, show tickets, or other activities. These packages can be a great way to save money on your overall trip, so keep them in mind when you are looking for a cheap hotel in Vegas.</li></ul><p>By comparing prices and shopping around, you can often save a significant amount of money on your hotel stay in Vegas. Whether you use hotel comparison sites, book directly with the hotel, sign up for email newsletters, or consider package deals, keep in mind that a little bit of research can go a long way when it comes to finding a great deal.</p><h2>Stay Off the Strip</h2><p>When it comes to getting a cheap hotel in Vegas, one of the best ways is to stay off the Strip. While the Strip is undoubtedly the heart of Las Vegas, it is also where most of the high-end hotels are located. Therefore, staying off the Strip can save you a lot of money while still allowing you to enjoy all that Vegas has to offer.</p><p>If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option that still has plenty of attractions, consider exploring Downtown Las Vegas. This area is full of historic buildings, art galleries, and museums, and is home to some of the most affordable hotels in the city. Some popular places to stay in Downtown Las Vegas include the Golden Nugget, the Plaza Hotel, and the El Cortez Hotel and Casino.</p><p>Another option to consider when trying to get a cheap hotel in Vegas is to stay in a nearby town. While this may require a bit more planning and transportation, it can also save you a significant amount of money. Some popular nearby towns to consider include Henderson, North Las Vegas, and Boulder City. These towns are all within a short drive of the city and offer a variety of budget-friendly hotels and motels.</p><ul><li>Keep in mind that staying off the Strip doesn’t mean you have to miss out on all the action. Many hotels offer free shuttle services to and from the Strip, so you can still enjoy the nightlife and attractions without breaking the bank.</li><li>Remember that the time of year you visit can also impact hotel prices. Vegas tends to be busiest during major holidays and events, so consider visiting during the off-season for the best deals.</li></ul><h2>Take Advantage of Loyalty Programs</h2><p>Las Vegas is known for its luxurious hotels and flashy resorts, but that doesn’t mean you have to break the bank to stay there. There are several ways to get a cheap hotel in Vegas, and taking advantage of loyalty programs is one of them.</p><p><b>Join Hotel Rewards Programs:</b> Many hotel chains offer loyalty programs that allow you to earn points for each stay. These points can then be redeemed for free nights or room upgrades. Some popular hotel chains in Vegas that offer loyalty programs include Hilton, Marriott, and Wyndham. Make sure to sign up for these programs before booking your stay.</p><p><b>Use Credit Card Points:</b> Some credit cards offer rewards points that can be redeemed for hotel stays. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card allows you to transfer points to several hotel loyalty programs, including Hyatt and Marriott. Keep in mind that you’ll need to have a good credit score to qualify for these types of credit cards.</p><p><b>Book Through Online Travel Agencies:</b> Online travel agencies like Expedia, Priceline, and Hotels.com often offer discounts on hotel bookings. These sites also have their own loyalty programs that allow you to earn points for each booking. Additionally, you can often find package deals that include both your hotel stay and flights, which can save you even more money.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that loyalty programs may also offer other perks, such as free breakfast or late checkout. However, keep in mind that some loyalty programs may have blackout dates or other restrictions. On the other hand, booking through an online travel agency may not earn you loyalty points with the hotel itself, but you may still be able to earn points through the travel agency’s program.</p><table><tr><th></th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr><tr><td>Hotel Rewards Programs</td><td>– Can earn free nights or room upgrades<br>– May offer additional perks like free breakfast or late checkout</td><td>– Blackout dates or other restrictions may apply<br>– Points may expire if not used within a certain timeframe</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Card Points</td><td>– Can transfer points to several hotel loyalty programs<br>– Some credit cards offer sign-up bonuses<br>– May offer other travel-related perks like travel insurance or airport lounge access</td><td>– Need to have a good credit score to qualify for some cards<br>– May have an annual fee</td></tr><tr><td>Online Travel Agencies</td><td>– Often offer discounts on hotel bookings<br>– Loyalty programs allow you to earn points for each booking<br>– Package deals can save you even more money</td><td>– May not earn you loyalty points with the hotel itself<br>– May have limited room selection</td></tr></table><p>Remember to always compare prices and options before booking your stay. It’s also a good idea to book your stay in advance and avoid peak travel times, as rates tend to be higher during these times. By taking advantage of loyalty programs and other discounts, you can get a cheap hotel in Vegas without sacrificing quality or comfort.</p><p>For more information, you can visit websites like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hilton Honors</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Marriott Bonvoy</a>, or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wyndham Rewards</a>.</p><h2>Be Flexible and Open-Minded</h2><p>When it comes to getting a cheap hotel in Vegas, being flexible and open-minded is key. This means considering alternative accommodations and being open to last-minute deals.</p><p>One alternative to traditional hotels is staying at a hostel. Hostels offer affordable rates for shared dormitory-style rooms and sometimes private rooms. Some popular hostels in Vegas include the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Las Vegas Hostel</a> and the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">USA Hostels Las Vegas</a>. Keep in mind that hostels may not offer the same amenities as hotels, but they can be a great budget-friendly option.</p><p>Another alternative accommodation to consider is renting a vacation home or apartment. Websites like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Airbnb</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">VRBO</a> offer a variety of affordable options for short-term rentals. These options can often be more cost-effective than hotels and also offer the convenience of a kitchen for cooking meals.</p><p>Being open to last-minute deals can also help save money on hotel stays in Vegas. Websites like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hotwire</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Priceline</a> offer deals on unsold hotel rooms, but keep in mind that the hotel may not be able to guarantee specific room types or locations.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that being flexible with travel dates can also help save money on hotel stays. Weekday rates are often cheaper than weekend rates, and traveling during off-peak seasons can also result in lower rates. On the other hand, popular events and holidays can cause hotel rates to increase.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>By following these tips and tricks, you can find a cheap hotel in Vegas without sacrificing quality or location. Remember to be flexible and open-minded, and always compare prices and shop around.
