In it, Ellie is seen smirking at the camera with her hair pulled back, wearing a casual outfit. In the caption, Treat mentioned that he missed his daughter.</p><p class=Fg>While Treat's last Instagram post was of his home, social media users were shocked to see that Treat's Twitter account appeared to remain active even after he passed away with a mysterious video appearing.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>The Video That Appeared on Treat's Page the Day After His Death</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=#><u>Treat</u></a> took to Instagram hours before his death to share photos and videos of his farm in Vermont. He showed what life on the farm was like as fans talked about how peaceful life there seemed.</p><p class=Fg>Treat loved his life on his farm in Vermont and often talked about how happy it made him.

There was something incredibly special about it to me, and the people here are incredibly honest, real, and good-humored."</p><p class=Fg>He went on to say that there was always something new to experience and discover in Vermont and that he woke every day grateful that he was able to see the view he could outside of his window.</p><p class=Fg>His love for Vermont remained firm to the very end. In fact, it seemed to last beyond his death. In the early hours of the morning after Treat passed away, a new post appeared on his Twitter timeline.</p><p class=Fg>The post was yet another video of his farm in Vermont. In the video, a tractor plowed through a field, and the caption <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/Rtreatwilliams/status/1668398606083055616><u>read</u></a>:</p><p class=Fg>"What a real Vermonter does."</p><p class=Fg>The tweet left some fans wondering if Treat had passed on, as others <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/Rtreatwilliams/status/1668398606083055616><u>said</u></a> the post-humous post was "eery."

His wife and two children then went on to share their own words. Their message talked about how heartbroken they were.</p><p class=Fg>They also talked about his career and how much he loved being an actor, and how he loved and appreciated each and every one of his fans sincerely. When revealing how Treat passed on, it <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://deadline.com/2023/06/treat-williams-dies-actor-everwood-hair-1235415225/><u>read</u></a>:</p><p class=Fg>"It is with great sadness that we report that our beloved Treat Williams has passed away tonight in Dorset, Vermont, after a fatal motorcycle accident. As you can imagine, we are shocked and greatly bereaved at this time."</p><p class=Fg>The family then asked Treat's fans for their respect and privacy as they grappled with their grief. They also requested that Treat's fans keep him in their thoughts and prayers over the coming weeks and months.</p><p class=Fg>Treat was 71 when he passed away, and his agent, Barry McPherson, shared exactly what had happened to him. Treat had been riding his <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/treat-williams-dead-at-71-7511398><u>motorcycle</u></a> when he tried to make a left or right turn, and another driver hit him. The accident occurred at around 5 p.m. on Monday evening on Route 30 just north of Morse Hill Road.</p><p class=Fg>A helicopter airlifted Treat from the scene, but ultimately he did not pull through.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b7bba6fce494d6c66aa2aa2d824cfe23cf900befe7fad20b20c2818062191831.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Treat Williams at the Tribeca Talks After The Movie: By Sidney Lumet in 2016 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Investigators believed that the accident may have happened because the driver of the car that hit Treat did not see the motorcycle. Treat was the only one that was hurt in the accident. The investigation team was to return to the scene the following day to investigate the incident further.</p><p class=Fg>Treat had an excellent career that spanned more than four decades, and he had more than 120 acting credits. He also built a beautiful family with his wife and two children and enjoyed being in Vermont. McPherson said Treat had always been a pleasure to work with and that he was proud of his career.</p><p class=Fg>Treat and his family has remained relatively private throughout his career. Still, they have attended a few red-carpet events together to celebrate Treat's many roles in famous TV shows and movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5303e9c137415b9bb2bffa2aea1e3b1504a73434190fb25b9386a4b578314e5c.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Treat Williams at the Emmy Awards Show, September 8,1996 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Tributes to Treat have poured in from around the globe since the news of his passing broke earlier this week.
