child she was not allowed to watch television.&nbsp;The first time she saw a movie was at a friend’s house and once she started she couldn’t stop.</span></p><p><span>Although the beginning of her career was tough and difficult, the actress was marred by many failed auditions three years after graduating from university and she pushed hard until she finally got her breakthrough roles as Myranda in the drama series&nbsp;</span><span>Game of Thrones</span><span>&nbsp;and Philippa Hawking in the 2014 biopic&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>The theory of everything.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Charlotte Hope Biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born October 15, 1991 in Salisbury,Wiltshire, England, Charlotte Hope hails from Lower Daggons, a small hamlet in the New Forest, Hampshire, England.&nbsp;She is a British national of White ethnicity.</span></p><p><span>From what little information we were able to gather about her family, we found that her father, a lawyer, used to be a jockey while her mother worked as a public relations officer before becoming a housewife.&nbsp;Charlotte also has a younger sister named Emily, but we’re yet to be sure if she’s her only sister.</span></p><p><span>Given her chosen career path, which she always had, it’s funny that Charlotte wasn’t allowed to watch TV as a kid.&nbsp;However, she did get a chance to see her first film,&nbsp;</span><span>Titanic,</span><span>&nbsp;during a sleepover at a friend’s house and once she started watching films, she couldn’t resist the urge to keep watching as her desire to be an actress grew.</span></p><span>Charlotte Hope attended the University of Oxford from where she earned degrees in French and Spanish.&nbsp;Three years after graduating from university, her attempts to find an acting job were unsuccessful, so she had to work as a waitress and in bars to make ends meet.</span><p><span>In order to improve her acting skills, she spent a year in Paris training at the Ecole Jacques Lecoq theater school and spent her free time watching films at the cinema.&nbsp;There she happened to meet a casting agent for a French film on the street, and her professional acting career began with the role of a factory woman in the musical&nbsp;</span><i><span>Les Miserables.&nbsp;</span></i><span>Afterwards, she wrote to the agents inviting them to see a play she was in and luckily one of them signed her.</span></p><p><span>Getting her break playing Ramsay Bolton’s love interest in 2013, Myranda starred in HBO’s fantasy drama series&nbsp;</span><i><span>Game of

character on the series was only supposed to appear in one scene, but because she delighted the producers with her performance, they continued to write her character through the next few seasons, until the character was killed off in season 6 .&nbsp;fourth, fifth and sixth seasons from 2013 to 2016. According to Charlotte Hope, her time on the show was “total magic”.&nbsp;The young actress also played the role of a prostitute in Felicity Jones’&nbsp;</span><span>The Invisible Woman</span><span>&nbsp;in 2013.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, she starred in the second season of&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Musketeers</span></i><span>&nbsp;and also played the role of Stephen Hawking’s younger sister, Philippa Hawking, in the film&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Theory of Everything.&nbsp;</span></i><span>The following year, she landed a starring role in the film&nbsp;</span><span>North vs. South</span><span>&nbsp;and later appeared in Olly Murs’ music video for the song “Beautiful to Me.”</span></p><p><span>We then saw the actress appear in two of 2016’s major films,&nbsp;</span><i><span>One United Kingdom</span></i><span>&nbsp;and the romantic thriller&nbsp;</span><i><span>Allies.&nbsp;</span></i><span>In the latter, Charlotte Hope starred alongside one of her favorite actors, David Oyelowo, and even wanted to take her days off just to watch him perform.</span></p><p><span>In 2017, she had a supporting role in the drama film&nbsp;</span><span>Three Christs,</span><span>&nbsp;opposite Richard Gere and Peter Dinklage&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;as Richard ‘s assistant, who played the role of a psychiatrist treating three women who believe they are the reincarnation of Christ.&nbsp;She followed that up the next year by starring in the horror film&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Nun,</span></i><span>&nbsp;which is a spin-off of the 2016 film,&nbsp;</span><span>The Conjuration 2.</span></p><p><span>Hope works in the upcoming TV series,&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Spanish Princess,</span></i><span>&nbsp;in which she portrayed the character of Catherine of Aragon.&nbsp;Considering the rate at which she’s growing in the acting business, it won’t be long before younger actors start looking to her for inspiration.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Facts about the Game of Thrones actress</span></strong></h2><h4><strong><span>stage performances</span></strong></h4><p><span>In addition to her work on screen, Charlotte Hope has also acted in plays, including Broadway shows such as&nbsp;</span><i><span>Buried Child</span></i><span>&nbsp;where she played the character of Shelly in 2016.&nbsp;The previous year she acted as Hernie in&nbsp;</span><i><span>A Midsummer Night</span></i><span>&nbsp;‘s Dream staged at Liverpool’s Everyman Theatre.&nbsp;She also played the role of Zara and Mother in&nbsp;</span><i><span>Albion</span></i><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><i><span>Gut für Otto,</span></i><span>&nbsp;held at Almeida Theater and Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theater.</span><i><br></i></p><h4><strong><span>Favorite Game Of Thrones scene</span></strong></h4><p><span>When this question was thrown at the actress during an interview, she revealed that the scene she enjoyed the most on the series was her sex scene with Ramsay in Season 5.&nbsp;In her opinion, the scene was empowering.&nbsp;However, Hope also acknowledged that it probably wasn’t normal to say so.</span></p><h4><strong><span>friend</span></strong></h4><p><span>Charlotte Hope is known from a screenwritersimple as Konrad.&nbsp;It is not known when their relationship started, but Hope seems very much in love with him and regularly uploads pictures of them together on Instagram.&nbsp;On Dec. 25, 2017, the actress posted a cozy photo she took with Konrad, saying she’s losing her followers because she’s been posting non-stop pictures of them together.</span></p><h4><strong><span>body stats</span></strong></h4><p><span>The talented actress measures 1.6 meters (5 feet 3 inches) in height and has body measurements of 33, 23.5 and 35 inches for her chest, waist and hips.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
