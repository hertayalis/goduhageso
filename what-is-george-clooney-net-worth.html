Read on to see how the man from Kentucky made his money…</p><h2>How did George make his money?</h2><p id=eV3ehXU8QKoY data-wc=42>The actor's colossal wealth is all thanks to his film and TV projects. George moved to LA to pursue the bright lights of Hollywood in his teenage years. The handsome actor's first role was as an extra in the TV miniseries Centennial.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9yFG2M9_8f data-wc=52>His landed his first major role in 1984 on short-lived sitcom E/R, which was on air for a year; a decade later, he starred on hospital drama ER. This was hailed as his breakthrough role, and George received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7ae0e925d30-gettyimages-673501722.jpg><p id=eB3rNCj_YS85 data-wc=56>Following his success, the man of the moment went on to star in From Dusk till Dawn, One Fine Day, The Perfect Storm, O Brother, Where Art Thou?&nbsp;and Ocean's Eleven (for which he reportedly made $20 million) to name a few. The latter inspired two sequels also starring George – Ocean's Twelve&nbsp;and Ocean's Thirteen.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJDC75IZujp data-wc=38>His most recent blockbusters include Money Monster, Hail, Caesar!, The Descendants, Gravity and Tomorrowland. After turning his hand to directing, George both starred and directed The Ides of March, The Monuments Men and Leatherheads&nbsp;to name a few.</p><h2>How many millions did George Clooney sell his tequila brand for?</h2><p id=ekagww_ilON3 data-wc=35>Apart from his glittering A-list Hollywood career, George can also call himself a tequila tycoon. The actor teamed up with Mike Meldman and Rande Gerber (Cindy Crawford's husband) to create their premium tequila brand, Casamigos.</p><p id=e8V24ufrI0 data-wc=48>The trio sold their business to Diageo for a reported £525 million in 2017. At the time, the alcohol giants said they would pay an additional £225 million depending on the brand's performance. Divided between the three owners, George is estimated to have made <strong>£112 million&nbsp;</strong>after taxes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54012937339f-george-clooney-casamigos-tequila.jpg><p id=eL0YNhIrnIVn data-wc=72>George made sure that he would still be involved in the business. He told&nbsp;International Business Times: "If you asked us four years ago if we had a billion dollar company, I don't think we would have said yes. This reflects Diageo's belief in our company and our belief in Diageo. But we're not going anywhere. We'll still be very much a part of Casamigos. Starting with a shot tonight. Maybe two."</p><p id=eLYMNn6-q8Wg data-wc=10><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Take a peek inside George and Amal's stunning home</a></p><p id=eNwS0mqINmpu data-wc=77>Diageo also released a statement, confirming: "To date, the founders have built a brand that has thrived under their organic approach in reaching and expanding their 'house of friends', and they will continue to promote the brand and provide their leadership and vision. We are delighted that the founders will have continued involvement and active participation in the future success of Casamigos. This, combined with the strengths of Diageo, will ensure the continued momentum of the brand."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/761d02642abc-george-amal-clooney-wedding-a.jpg><h2>Is George Clooney planning to retire?</h2><p id=eurJUidUL1nK data-wc=67>With millions in the bank, the father-of-two could be excused for not wanting to ever work again. George has openly said he doesn't need the money, and he's being more picky with his film and TV projects, but that doesn't mean he plans to retire any time soon. "Look, I acted for a long time and, you know, I'm 56," he told The Sunday Times in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUqZs0MAL7u data-wc=52>"I'm not the guy that gets the girl any more. But, look, if somebody's got Paul Newman in The Verdict, I'd jump. But there aren't that many like that. Acting used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion dollars. I don't need money."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a6ba817867a6-george-clooney-amal-clooney.jpg><p id=eNq6NLFZOe2y data-wc=13><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: George opens up about his 'elegant' daughter Ella and 'thug' son Alexander</a></p><p id=e9cfF45pkPHf data-wc=78>"I have money," he continued. "So, I can fight to make movies I want to make. If you look at what I've been in over the past 15 years, for the most part they weren't going to get made if I didn't do them. Nobody was going to make Good Night, and Good Luck, Michael Clayton or Up in the Air, and I fought to get those out there. I'll make money other ways if I have to."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4b198b14d274-gettyimages-1429056380.jpg><h2>What charity work does George Clooney do?</h2><p id=eA-rchSMlO-u data-wc=37>George and his wife Amal have contributed to various causes close to their heart.
