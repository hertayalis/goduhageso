He is also known under the pseudonym The Weasel. This American comedian is known as a host of MTV and for his notable acting in films “Encino Man”, “Son in Law”, “In the Army” and for his own produced and directed comedy film “Pauly Shore is Dead” where Pauly Shore was one of the cast members. Paul Montgomery Shore was born in Hollywood, California, Unites States, in 1968. Both of his parents were comedy actors. His mother, <a href=#>Mitzi Shore</a>, was the founder of “The Comedy Store” the well-known comedy club which was located in West Hollywood, California. His father Sammy Shore was a comedy actor. He was raised Jewish.</p><h3>Pauly Shore Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Pauly Shore started his career just after he graduated from Beverly Hills High school. Inspired by his parents he began touring circuit through the comedy clubs under the pseudonym “The Weasel”. He was using surfer parlance adding dude speak slang. At that time his classmates were interested in college studies. Pauly Shore net worth started to grow significantly only after he joined MTV, though. He hosted his own show “Totally Pauly” and after some time he released a music video “Lisa, Lisa, the One I Adore”. He also participated in music video “N 2 Gether Now” in American rock band Limp Bizkit music video as a pizza delivery man.</p><p>Pauly was gathering his net worth not only working in television and comedy clubs, taking parts in films also helped him to increase Shore fame and net worth. He took small part in films like “For Keeps” directed by John G. Avildsen, “18 again” directed by Paul Flaherty, “Los Angeles” directed by Hugh Hudson, “Phantom of the Mall: Eric”s Revenge” directed by Richard Friedman. Moreover, his later performances in films like comedies “Encino Man” directed by Les Mayfield, “Son in Law” directed by Steve Rash, “In the Army Now” directed by Daniel Petrie Jr., “Jury Duty” directed by John Fortenberry, “Bio Dome” directed by <a href=#>Jason Bloom</a> earned negative reviews and they weren”t very popular among audience as their box office earned not much. Later Shore raised his net worth while taking parts in films “Casper meets Wendy” directed by Sean McNamara, “An Extremely Goofy Movie” directed by Ian Harrowell and Douglas McCarthy, “The Wash” directed by DJ Pooh, “Opposite Day” directed by R. Michael Givens, “Stonerville” directed by <a href=#>Bill Corcoran</a>, “Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star” directed by <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> and “Whiskey Business”.</p><p>In 2003, Pauly Shore increased his net worth after he produced, wrote, directed and starred “Pauly Shore is Dead” that was a semi-autobiographical mocumentary film, co-starring with <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a>, <a href=#>Eminem</a>, <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>, <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, <a href=#>Tommy Lee</a> and other celebrities. This film earned the first and only positive reviews in Pauly Shore film career.</p><p>Pauly was accumulating his net worth while performing and touring with his comedy performances in the United States in 2012. Pauly Shore hasn”t been married.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.239782016349><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Pauly Shore</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>1.6&nbsp;million GBP</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 1, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 7 in (1.71 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>67&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Profession</td><td>Comedian, Improvisational comedy Actor, Screenwriter, Film Producer, Film director, Presenter, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Beverly Hills High school</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Mitzi Shore, Sammy Shore</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Peter Shore</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Paul Montgomery Shore , The Weasel , Eugene Shore , Pauley Shore , Paul Montgomery "Pauly" Shore</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/OfficialPaulyShore</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/paulyshore</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/paulyshore</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/paulyshore</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001736</a></td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>"Limp Bizkit"</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>"Encino Man", "Son in Law", "In the Army", "Pauly Shore is Dead","Los Angeles", "Jury Duty", "Phantom of the Mall: Eric"s Revenge", "Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star"</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Totally Pauly", "Lisa, Lisa, the One I Adore", "N 2 Gether Now", "The Comedy Store", "N 2 Gether Now" (music video)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=2.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Known for his spaced-out delivery in a surfer accent, and stretching out certain words, like "bud-dy".</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=40.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=8><td>1</td><td>[on the Playboy Mansion] I probably spend more time there than I do out in public. They're like "can you leave now" and I'm like "but I've got nothing to do!" No, really though it's just one of those perks that you get when you become known, and Mr. Heffner was nice enough to have me as a guest many years ago, so I've been going up there once in a while ever since.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>That I care for my fans and that I care for my mom and I just care. I'm not 25 years old anymore. I'm not some druggie. I'm not banging chicks every night. I'm not an E! True Hollywood Story. I work really hard at what I do. I enjoy making people happy.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>[on his favorite role] I liked all of them. I liked Encino Man. I thought that was fun. I liked Son In Law, In the Army Now. I liked Jury Duty. I liked Bio-Dome. I liked all the movies that I did the voices in, movies that I did parts in, I liked all of them. There's not a favorite.</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>4</td><td>[on making studio films] I miss them a lot. I miss working with great actors, working with great directors. I miss-I don't want to say it was less pressure, but in a way, it was just because I was doing my thing, and I didn't have to worry about all the other stuff that comes along with it. You know, I miss acting, that's the main thing. I miss that process of getting the script and reading it and working on it.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>5</td><td>[on his weasel character] I was never like Pee-wee Herman, how Paul Reubens is on the left and Pee-wee is on the right. I was one with the Weas. I really dressed like that. I acted like that. I exaggerated it for the camera, for sure. But I would go out like that.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>6</td><td>[on dating Kylie Minogue] Yeah. That was when we did Bio-Dome. She was in Bio-Dome with me. That's kind of the one thing I miss about starring in films: hooking up with your co-stars.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>7</td><td>[on when the Pauly Shore era ended] Probably after my sitcom got canceled. I was on the road one night by myself and I realized, "Well, the jig is up. Time to move on".</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>8</td><td>[on his favorite comedian] Growing up as a kid I'd say Richard Pryor. Because he was very vulnerable on stage and very sweet and endearing, yet very dirty and nasty as well. I think that it's important that you connect with the audience, that's the most important thing. All the material and all that other stuff don't really mean anything unless you're connecting with them. There's a lot of comics that go up there and just kind of babble their routine and they're separated from the audience you know what I mean?</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>9</td><td>[on his 90's films] It's better to have someone know me for something than have them not know me for anything. The films were good films. They hold up, they constantly play and they're a reason why I still have an audience to be quite honest.</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>10</td><td>I won't say I love everything I ever did, but I have to say, I honestly like all the stuff I starred in. I really like "Bio-Dome" and "Jury Duty," even though they didn't do as well as the other ones. "Bio-Dome" has become sort of a cult classic over the years. I'm proud of those movies, and when people come to the shows, they've usually seen every one of them. People love those movies, probably more now.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>11</td><td>[on the decline of MTV] It's not just MTV, it's pretty much all the channels. America seems to be fascinated with people who are not talented. America wants to see "Duck Dynasty" and "Storage Wars." It's not MTV's fault it's the viewers fault.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>12</td><td>[on the TV show Entourage] It's like the mafia: Either you're in the family or not. A lot of the guys who run the show are my friends. I'm friends with Kevin Dillon and all those guys. So it wasn't like that gig came through my agent.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>13</td><td>I'm Jewish. I've always had a thing where it's okay to dance with the devil, just don't become the devil. Even at my peak, I never went too over the top.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=19.773635153129><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.6041666666667><td>1</td><td>Is briefly mentioned in the <a href=#>'Weird Al' Yankovic</a> songs "Albuquerque" and "Confessions Part III".</td></tr><tr readability=1.5308641975309><td>2</td><td>Was considered for the role of Leonard Hofstadter on <a href=#>The Big Bang Theory</a> (2007).</td></tr><tr readability=1.5324675324675><td>3</td><td>Was considered for the role of Michael McManus in <a href=#>The Usual Suspects</a> (1995).</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Is a vegetarian.</td></tr><tr readability=3.4526315789474><td>5</td><td>Through his mother, he was a good friend of <a href=#>Richard Pryor</a>, who influenced him choosing comedy.</td></tr><tr readability=1.063829787234><td>6</td><td>Good friends with <a href=#>Jason Mewes</a> and <a href=#>Kevin Smith</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=8.9320388349515><td>7</td><td>Along with Pia Zadora, Madonna, Sylvester Stallone and Demi Moore, one of the few people who have "won" back to back awards at the Razzies in successive years.
